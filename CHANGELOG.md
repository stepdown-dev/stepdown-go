# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-06-03

Documentation and help maintenance release. No analyzer behavior, grammar,
diagnostic, fixture policy, waiver posture, or invocation semantics changed.

### Changed

- Public README, command help, tests, and active toolchain-contract specs now
  show the current `go run stepdown.dev/go/cmd/stepdown@v0.1.3 ./...`
  consumption pin.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-06-03

Maintenance release. No analyzer behavior, grammar, diagnostic, fixture policy,
or public invocation changes.

### Changed

- Local and CI verification now run under Go 1.26.4, preserving the Go 1.26
  line while moving off the vulnerable 1.26.3 patch.
- Toolchain contract docs and verification fixtures now reflect Go 1.26.4.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

Rehomed. No functional or grammar changes.

### Changed

- Repository moved to `github.com/stepdown-dev/stepdown-go`; the module path is now the vanity import path `stepdown.dev/go`, resolved by a `go-import` meta tag. Pin with `go run stepdown.dev/go/cmd/stepdown@v0.1.1 ./...`.
- Owner is Stinnett Holdings LLC. `v0.1.0` and earlier remain available under the predecessor module path but do not resolve at `stepdown.dev/go`.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

Initial release. `stepdown` enforces top-down declaration order in Go source files through a positive grammar, specified by [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-stepdown-go-structure-analyzer.md).

### Added

- Structural analyzer that enforces file-level section order: package, imports, constants, package vars, per-type blocks, exported package-level functions, then unexported package-level helper functions.
- Per-type blocks ordered as constructors, getters, setters, then non-accessor receiver methods, with each type's block contiguous in source order.
- Depth-first ordering of receiver methods from exported roots: each exported method is followed by the unexported methods it calls, with shared callees owned by the first exported root in source order.
- Acceptance of single-spec type declarations of any form (struct, interface, named primitive, function type, map, slice, alias). Getter and setter rules apply only to struct types.
- Same-file receiver type requirement: a receiver method's type must be declared in the same file.
- File selection via `go/packages`, skipping test files, generated files (Go generated-code marker), and files outside the default build.
- Diagnostics in `file:line:column: rule-name: description` format with stable rule names.
- Command-line interface accepting Go package patterns, with `-h`/`--help`/`-help` and exit codes `0` (clean), `1` (findings), `2` (tool or load error).
- Self-policing: `stepdown` runs against its own source as part of verification.
- Apache 2.0 license.
